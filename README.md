# Gdriveupdatefile
Best if you follow this guide to get started: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python
You basically need pip, Python 2.6 or higher, a Google account with Google Drive.
Be aware that your Google account's organizations can prevent you from creating api credentials
This program was made for ease of updating a file I like to keep as backup and use frequently
across different devices. It was also used to learn a little Python and some quick API.
